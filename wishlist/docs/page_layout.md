# Wishlist App - Frontend Overview

## Landing Page

The landing page of the **Wishlist** app is the first screen users interact with. It features:

- A blurred background with SVG circle art for a soft visual effect.
- A central **Wishlist** logo and title to give the app a welcoming feel.
- A **Login with Google** button that, for now, routes users to the **Home Screen**.

### Future Features

- Implement Google OAuth for login functionality.
